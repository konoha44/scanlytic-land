# 5 Best Practices for QR Code Marketing

QR codes have become an essential tool in modern marketing strategies. When used effectively, they can bridge the gap between physical and digital experiences, providing valuable data insights along the way.

## 1. Always Include a Call to Action

Never assume users know what to do with your QR code. Always include a clear call to action that tells them what they'll get when they scan:

- "Scan for exclusive discount"
- "Scan to learn more"
- "Scan to register"

## 2. Test Your QR Codes Before Launching

Always test your QR codes on various devices and in different lighting conditions before finalizing your marketing materials. Nothing hurts campaign performance more than a QR code that doesn't work properly.

## 3. Design for Scannability

While you can customize QR codes with colors and logos, always maintain enough contrast and preserve the essential scanning elements. Remember that function comes before style when it comes to QR codes.

## 4. Use Analytics to Track Performance

With Scanlytic, you can track when, where, and how often your QR codes are scanned. Use these insights to optimize your campaigns and understand your audience better.

## 5. Create Dedicated Landing Pages

Don't send users to your generic homepage. Create dedicated landing pages that continue the message from where the QR code was scanned, providing a seamless user experience.
